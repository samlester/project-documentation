			<h2>7.1 Research</h2>
			<p>I approached the initial research with a somewhat naive approach, having never attempted a project of this scale before. While I think my literature review is passable it could have been a lot more insightful if I'd have spent more time planning a structure and focusing my research rather than just 'diving in'.</p>
			<p>I felt much more at ease with the primary research. The focus group – while extremely useful in terms of the knowledge I captured from it – was perhaps not strucutred enough. Had I gone into the group with more specific aims I believe I could have got more succinct results with more relevance to the specifics of my project.</p>
			<p>One problem with my primary research is the lack of any quantitative data from an online survey. Most of my colleagues carried out some kind of mass survey and I would have liked to have got that kind of raw analysable data for my project. My decision to go with a qualitative focus group was based mainly of the specifics of who's opinion I needed to get – Scoop is very industry and job role specific and so survey responses from people outside of the digital industry wouldn't have been as useful as for other projects. I still believe I took the right path but perhaps I should have carried out a keyword analysis of the focus group transcript to get the raw data.</p>

			<h2>7.2 Creating the artefact</h2>
			<p>Prior to beginning the main artefact build I spent a good deal of time researching the basics of Ruby and Ruby on Rails. I always knew that choosing a language and framework I had never used before would make the project more difficult and require more work on getting up to speed with the system. To learn Rails I followed a variety of tutorials.</p>
			<p>I also took the approach of building the crawl functionality as a Ruby command line script prior to attempting to integrate it with Rails – this pushed the artefact build back further.</p>
			<p>Although I began the main artefact later that expected I believe that this may actually have improved my artefact as I had more pre-existing knowledge of the system meaning that I didn't make as many stupid mistakes when working on the real project.</p>
			<p>Despite functioning correctly throughout the application has a number of problems which would impede it's use in industry in it's current site, particularly the speed at which it crawls sites. From my experience the app crawls sites at a rate of just over one page per second so for a site of several hundred page this would be an issue. My inexperience in writing the background method for the crawl process is one of the biggest reasons for this speed hit and if I'd had time I would have liked to rewrite the process to split larger sites into multiple background processes.</p>

			<h2>7.3 Testing</h2>
			<p>The testing was easily my favourite part of the project and also the part that I feel got the best results. I'd wanted to try some user testing for a long time and this was the perfect opportunity to try it.</p>
			<p>Originally I had decided to simply watch the users while they used the application and make notes about their thoughts and direction. I discovered Silverback fairly late but put it to good use to get a more in-depth look at the way that people use the system, combining the user test with a simple survey allowed me to get more data from the participants.</p>
			<p>I found it very difficult to keep quiet during the tests and simply let the participant explore the system as is evidenced in the videos. If I were to do more user testing in future I would make more effort to provide the participant with a clear brief and the simple see how they use the system without instruction.</p>

			<h2>7.4 Writing the report</h2>
			<p>The layout of this report was of of the more enjoyable aspects of the project. Designing a report like document using markup was – similar to the way that books in the ePub format are created. Getting to grips with how to mark up an academic paper using HTML5 was also an interesting challenge and I found myself referring to the W3 specification quite often.</p>
			<p>Despite my success with this I found the actual words and process explanation much more difficult to come up with and often found myself writing too far down irrelevant routes then having to go back and strip it out later.</p>

			<h2>7.6 Conclusion</h2>
			<p>Overall I feel that the project went well and produced a piece of software that, with some modification could potentially be launched as a SaaS (Software as a Service) product for digital agencies.</p>
			<p>While I encountered many issues throughout the project it seems that I overcame them</p>
