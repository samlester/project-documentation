			<h2>5.1 Inspiration</h2>
			<p>The first stage in the design process was to look at existing apps and trends to get an idea of what a modern, design-focused web application looks like as well as gauging my personal likes and dislikes.</p>

			<h3>Other web applications</h3>
			<p>Researching into other applications involved signing up for free accounts at many services to get a feel for their interfaces and process flows. While it would be more useful if these were the existing content strategy applications researched in the previous chapter none of them have a particularly design-focused aesthetic.</p>
			<p>Three of the applications I tested were particularly interesting:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Layervault, an application for managing revisions to Photoshop files (<a href="https://layervault.com/">https://layervault.com/</a>)</li>
				<li>Iceber.gs, a Pinterest-like application for collecting design inspiration and ideas (<a href="https://iceber.gs/site">https://iceber.gs/site</a>)</li>
				<li>Basecamp, a project management application (<a href="http://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a>)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>All of these applications embrace the clear typography.</p>

			<h3>Concept click-through</h3>
			<p><span class="revise">At this early stage in the development of the feature set the exact nature of the tool was hazy so I decided to create a mockup click-through instead of a full interactive prototype.</span></p>
			<p>After I completed the click-through I presented it to Ten4 for feedback. I received the following thoughts:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Clean but somewhat boring design</li>
				<li>Looks simple to set up audits</li>
				<li>End point not flexible enough</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

			<h2>5.5 Revised designs</h2>
			<p>After the feedback from my concept designs it was clear that revisions were needed to make the more fit-for-purpose. <span class="more"></span></p>
			<p>At this point I also knew that my application would be built using the Bootstrap framework so I aimed to adapt the layout slightly to suit the framework better.</p>
