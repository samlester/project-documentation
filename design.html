			<h3>Concept click-through</h3>
			<p>At this early stage in the development of the feature set the exact nature of the tool was hazy so I decided to create a mockup click-through instead of a full interactive prototype.</p>
			<p>This allowed me to get a better idea of general feeling towards the visual design and proposed functionality of the project without wasting time creating parts of the application that would never be used.</p>
			<p>After I completed the click-through I presented it to Ten4 for feedback. I received the following thoughts:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Clean but somewhat boring design</li>
				<li>Simple to set up audits</li>
				<li>End point not flexible enough</li>
				<li>Team functionality would be good</li>
			</ul>
