			<h2>3.1 Competing solutions</h2>
			<p>Various solutions exist for the laborious processes surrounding content strategy but while some partially automate the process they rarely have a focus on content strategy as a primary market. The following table summarises three of the most interesting and prominent competing products:</p>

			<h2>3.2 Focus group</h2>
			<aside class="note pull-right">
				<h2>Ethical approval</h2>
				<p>Completed consent forms for all of my research are available in the appendix.</p>
				<a href="#">#</a>
			</aside>
			<p>In order to find out more about how elements of content strategy are used within industry I conducted a small focus group with participants from the project management, UX and development sides of the process.</p>
			<p>I decided that a focus group was the best way to get a general feel for the industry and despite not providing me with any quantitative data it enabled me to use my industry contacts to get time with real web professionals.</p>

			<h3>Aims and questions</h3>
			<p>Before the focus group I thought about the main aims of the sessions, particularly the information and understanding that I aimed to come out with. I distilled my aims down to these three:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Find out how web professionals use content strategy in real projects</li>
				<li>Understand the motivation and process involved in a content audit</li>
				<li>See whether there's a market for the application</li>
			</ul>
			<p>I also put together a question list. This allowed me to structure the group in such a way that I didn't lead the participants to a particular outcome while still getting the information outlined in my aims:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>What's the current process for planning a website for a client project?</li>
				<li>Has the recent shift towards mobile and tablet devices changed existing UX strategy processes? If so, how?</li>
				<li>Is there more planning involved? More content strategy?</li>
				<li>Is it difficult to sell these content strategy and UX services to clients?</li>
				<li>What's the best way to measure how effective a piece of content is?</li>
				<li>In what situation(s) do you perform a content audit before building a site?</li>
				<li>What information do you aim to get out of a content audit?</li>
				<li>What tools and processes do you use to carry out content audits?</li>
				<li>Do you show the results of the content audit to clients or just keep it internal?</li>
			</ol>
			
			<h3>Participants</h3>
			<p>I selected three participants to present a balanced view of the website creation process. They are all currently working at Ten4 Design.</p>

			<h4>Liz Walker</h4>
			<p>Liz Walker is a Director and Project Manager at Ten4 Design. Her work varies from day to day but consists mainly of communicating effectively with clients, delegating tasks to members of the team and helping to plan websites using industry standard methods like wireframes and site maps.</p>

			<h4>John Stewart</h4>
			<p>John Stewart is a UI Developer and Project Manager at Ten4 Design. His work is split between project management and developing various sites using Content Management Systems like ExpressionEngine. He also has experience with SaaS (Software as a Service) products having developed one as Product Manager at another company, Quarter.</p>

			<h4>Andy Green</h4>
			<p>Andy Green is a Front-end Developer at Ten4 Design. His work mainly consists of creating websites from mockups and integrating them with various Content Management Systems. He also advises designers on technical limitations during the planning and design phase to ensure development goes as smoothly as possible.</p>

			<h2>3.3 Findings</h2>
			<p>After the focus group I <a href="<!-- @path appendix/focus-group-transcript.html -->">transcribed the recording</a> so I could read through and analyse the comments made by the participants. My findings are summarised below:</p>
			
			<h4>The emergence of mobile has led to more focus on content</h4>
			<p>The recent trend towards much higher mobile usage and the prevalance of responsive design and development have led to more focus on the content of websites and thus, content strategy.</p>

			<h4>The main constraints on content audits are time and budget</h4>
			<p>Ten4 would carry out more content audits if there were a quicker, easier way to generate them. This clearly validates the use case for my application.</p>

			<h4>The current content auditing process takes a long time</h4>
			<p>One specific project mentioned (Anabel Karmel) was undergoing an audit at the time of the focus group. It was a very large site and Ten4 were surprised how long it took to compile the data for each page.</p>

			<h3>Application end point</h3>
			<p>One of the key things that came out of my research was the lack of a defined end point for my application - potential users understood the usefulness of the information they could gain but didn't really see a way to export the data or fit it into their workflow.</p>
			<p>As workflow is so key to web professionals approach to products and services I decided to explore the various options available to be used as the application's end point.</p>
			<p>Sitemaps were a strong contender at first as they strongly support the re-design side of the content audit. A user could select pages from the current site and drag them onto a canvas to organise and arrange them in a more logical manner. Despite positive feedback about this ides it seemed quite strange from a workflow point of view to start a re-design by using very specific information about the old site rather than a blank slate.</p>
			<p>The end point that I chose was a report that highlights well and poorly performing content across a site for the purposes of content clean-up and optimisation rather than the basis of a re-designed site. The core of the idea is that a web professional would run the audit and categorise each page's content into one of the ROT (Redundant, Out-of-date, Trivial) groups or mark it as valuable content. Comments about specific content could then be added and a report printed to present to the client as a guide to help them review their online content.</p>
