			<p>In this chapter I will research various areas related to my project including industry practices, content strategy processes and prototyping.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="section" id="content-strategy">
			<h2>2.1 Content strategy</h2>
			<p>Content powers the whole dynamic of the web and now, with many traditional businesses almost entirely powered by the web it's more important than ever for marketing personnel to stay on top of the content provided by their sites. Dealing with improving content across a large site is a big job and presents all sorts of problems. <span class="more"></span></p>
			<p>Content strategy is a relatively new field in the web industry which aims to solve these problems. Closely linked to User Experience Design, it's a broad term which covers the processes used to examine the systems that create, distribute and analyse content. <span class="cite"></span></p>

			<h3>The importance of content for clients</h3>
			<p>While the purposes of different websites vary massively the majority of commercial properties have a few business goals in common. They either aim to persuade you to carry out an action (e.g. buying a book on Amazon, sharing a cat video on YouTube) or provide you with information about a product, topic or service.</p>
			<p>The content provided by a website is the vehicle that links these business goals with the user and clients are now beginning to consider the quality, organisation and relevance of their content over the design and visual style of the site.</p>
			<p>The simple fact is that websites with great content attract more visitors and whether that results in more sales, happier customers or a video going viral it's generally a good thing. The flip side is that bad content drives people away. Halvorson and Rach (2012, p. 15) note that <q>when content sucks &mdash; when it's overwritten, redundant, hard-to-find, irrelevant &mdash; people come, look, and leave. And sometimes they never come back</q>.</p>
			
			<h3>Content auditing</h3>
			<p>The majority of projects now being approached by web agencies are re-designs of existing sites rather than entirely new ventures, the sub-field of content auditing aims to analyse the content on the old site for the purposes of either informing the design and development of a new site or the updating of content on the existing one.</p>
			<p>Kissane (2011 p. 52) notes that we need to need to discover and assess what content already exists before even thinking about how to structure or design a replacement site. On smaller sites this is relatively easy to do, it's a process of simply clicking through the navigation and looking at the structure of the content. On larger sites with hundreds of pages this is a much more difficult objective. Older sites have often grown far beyond their original designers and developers intended and there are lots of pages buried deep within different sub-sections.</p>
			<p>The process of collecting standard information (e.g. title, URL, metadata, H1) about all the existing pages on a website is often called a quantitative audit or content inventory. Carrying out a quantitative audit is important because it allows an agency to assess the content and structure of a current site so they can see the areas which most need improvement and attention during the design of the new site. It's also one of the quickest and easiest ways to find out about the site content as it can be automated (Halvorson, K. and Rach M., 2012, p. 15).</p>
			<p>Many content strategists use a qualitative approach to assess websites, providing a deeper look at the quality and usefulness of the content to particular user groups. This approach is much more informal and often aims to make a judgement on whether larger areas and of the site are performing as required rather than analysing specific pages.</p>
			<p>Halvorson and Rach (2012, p. 53) note that quantitative audits are helpful but only up to a certain point. The main problem is that the process only gives you the most basic information about the pages rather than more in-depth opinion and assessment of content quality, relevance and usefulness. While this makes the process somewhat less useful than a qualitative audit it also makes it a lot easier to do automatically using the same technologies that search engines use to 'spider' web pages.</p>
			<p><span class="review">Neither method is better than the other, the key is to use both approaches together; quantitative to get a broad overview of the content and qualitative to increase the depth of the data <span class="cite" src="clout170"></span>. The ideal content strategy tool would combine elements of both to allow web agencies to audit websites quickly while still adding and reviewing content quality and relevance.</span></p>

			<h3>Assessing content quality, relevance and usefulness</h3>
			<p>When assessing the quality of content many content strategists simply write notes about the site rather than putting their thoughts in any kind of order. This means that the information contained in a qualitative audit can be difficult to understand and digest particularly if handed directly to clients.</p>
			<p>If any output from a content audit is to be given directly to a client without any significant pre-processing it needs to be in a more coherent order. Kadec (2013, p. 142) suggests three broad categories into which all 'bad content' can be categorised:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Redundant: Page that is no longer necessary or is duplicated elsewhere</li>
				<li>Out-of-date: Pages that should be on the site but need updating to continue being relevant</li>
				<li>Trivial: Pages that don't contain any useful or relevant information</li>
			</ul>
			<p><span class="review">An approach which uses an automated method to retrieve information about the pages on a website and a framework for qualitative information like the one above would provide the perfect balance between the two approaches to auditing.</span> <span class="more"></span></p>
			<p>In addition to this categorisation its always important to give a space for specific notes. Data is incredibly useful but it shouldn't be a substitute for intelligent thought. <span class="cite" src="clout"></span></p>

		<div class="section" id="user-interface-design">
			<h2>2.2 User interface design</h2>
			<p>As user interfaces have become ever more complex there has been a greater need for a more considered approach to the design of this crucial barrier between the user and the task they want to perform.</p>

			<h3>Visual design</h3>
			<p>A crucial aspect of any web application is it's look and feel. This visual side changes the feel of the product to make it fit in more closely with the target market. The design and technology market that the application is targeted at is very design literate meaning that the appearance of the application may used as a differentiator between different options<span class="cite" src="designforhackers25"></span></p>
			<p>When the visual design is this important it becomes as important to the product's success as usability as the user experience relys so heavily upon it <span class="cite" src="designforhackers25"></span>. Sometimes design can be the advantage.</p>

			<h3>Usability</h3>
			<p>Much academic work about usability focuses on how to design interfaces that user instantly knows how to use, without being primed on the subject or interface.</p>
			<p>Jakob Nielsenâ€™s 10 Usability Heuristics <span class="cite"></span>, so called because they define a set of guidelines rather than being specific rules.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Visibility of system status</li>
				<li>Match between system and the real world</li>
				<li>User control and freedom</li>
				<li>Consistency and standards</li>
				<li>Error prevention</li>
				<li>Recognition rather than recall</li>
				<li>Flexibility and efficiency of use</li>
				<li>Aesthetic and minimalist design</li>
				<li>Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors</li>
				<li>Help and documentation</li>
			</ol>
			<p>These guidelines define a few key <span class="more"></span></p>

			<h3>Iterative design</h3>
			<p>No matter how closely a user interface sticks to guidelines there's no substitute for testing with potential users. Iterative design is a  methodology that centres on a core cycle of design, testing and analysis which aims to create better user interfaces though early interaction with the target users. <span class="cite"></span></p>
			<p></p>

			<h3>Design methods</h3>
			<p>The visualisation and design of complex user interface design has become a large field in recent years and now contains a variety of techniques and disciplines.</p>
			<p>Wireframing is a key stage to developing web applications which involved taking ideas and thoughts from earlier planning stages and expressing them on paper for the first time. Effective wireframes show the structure and layout of the page without adding superfluous details like colour or design style <span class="cite"></span>. This method of showing only the basics of each page makes them ideal for exploring and iterating different user flows, layouts and ideas.</p>
			<p>Wireframes can take many different forms and their complexity varies greatly depending on the project. The most common way of creating wireframes is using a simple marker and paper although software packages like Omnigraffle and Balsamiq exist specifically to create higher fidelty drawings. Wireframes can also be created using CSS with the added advantage of being able to use the code later on in the project.</p>

			<h4>Design trends</h4>
			<p>A recent trend in the visual design of web applications is 'flat design', a clear reaction to the overly skeuomorphic designs that have previously dominated the market.</p>
			<p>Skeuomorphism is an obscure word which defines the way that designs sometimes inherit textures or layout from past versions <span class="cite" src="sasha"></span>. For instance Apple's iOS Notes application features a yellow lined background, borrowing from the physical item it replaces. This 'faux-realism' has become a hot button topic in the design world. <span class="more"></span></p>
			<p>Recently flat design has become more prevalent, led in part by Microsoft's Metro design language which shuns any kind of skeuomorphism by using only flat tiles.</p>
			<p>Flat design also naturally lends itself towards usable applications</p>

			
			<h3>Websites vs. web applications</h3>
			<p>Although web applications are built using many of the same technologies as websites they are fundamentally different.</p>
			<p>For this reason common information architecture tools like site maps, card sorting and . are unnecessary as they are concerned with organising information rather than leading the user through a process.</p>
			<p>Zamboni (2012, p. 123) shows the differences very succinctly by directly comparing the users goals and concerns when they are using a website as opposed to a web app:</p>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr>
						<th></th>
						<th>Website</th>
						<th>Web app</th>
					</tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<th>User goal</th>
						<td>Find information</td>
						<td>Complete a task</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>User journey</th>
						<td>Haphazard</td>
						<td>Linear</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>User interface</th>
						<td>Content and menus</td>
						<td>Forms</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>Primary concern</th>
						<td>Information space</td>
						<td>Application flows</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>Digital technique</th>
						<td>Information architecture</td>
						<td>Interaction design</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>

		<div class="section" id="prototyping">
			<h2>2.3 Prototyping</h2>
			<p>When developing a web application the user is always at the centre of thinking. Rapid prototypes are a great way of integrating the user's opinion in the design and development cycle.</p>
			<p>There are lots of ways of prototyping, each suited to a particular use case or stage of development.</p>

			<h3>Paper prototyping</h3>
			<p>The quickest, cheapest way to create a prototype is using paper. While basic, this low-tech approach can be particularly effective in the early stages of a project when combined with wireframing. Clicks can be simulated by switching between pages which means that some basic user testing is still possible.</p>

			<h3>Web prototyping</h3>
			<p>One practical method of helping iterative design to work in an increasingly technical context is to build quick, dirty prototypes designed to represent the interface in it's most basic form and allow user testing to take place long before the product is at the stage when it could be released into the marketplace.</p>
			<p>Warfel (2009, p. 4) notes that the key thing about prototypes is that they go a lot further that requirements documents by letting potential users experience and design and provide real-time feedback to a developer. Web-based prototypes excel at this by placing the application design within it's real environment. If created especially carefully web prototypes can also be used as a basis for production code using a framework like Twitter Bootstrap.</p>
			
			<h3>Interactive prototyping</h3>
			<p>One of the best ways to prototype web applications is to create a clickable representation of the finished products. There are lots of different tools that can be used to creating them including Powerpoint and Keynote thanks to their link features.</p>
			<p>Alternatively a semi-interactive prototype can be produced using clickthrough images. Although this loses some of the user testing applications that the web-based prototype provides it's much quicker to produce and iterate.</p>

		<div class="section" id="understanding-the-user">
			<h2>2.4 Understanding the user</h2>
			<p>It's key when creating any sort of human-computer interface to understand the people who are going to be using it.</p>
			
			<h3>Identifying the target audience</h3>
			<p>It's also important to not focus on just managers or directors as a balanced </p>

			<h3>Establishing user needs</h3>
			<p>At this stage there's a clear vision of what Scoop is trying to accomplish but it's necessary to establish whether the concept matches up with what real users need from a content auditing tool.</p>
			<p>One easy way of finding out what users want from a product is through a short survey sent to people identified as part of the target audience. This can generate mountains of quantitative data for analysis later on can give the researcher a skewed view of the audience as <span class="more"></span></p>
			<p>Surveys can be a useful tool but the biggest insights in answering this question can be found by simply talking to potential users through a focus group. For this project the key questions to ask within a focus group relate to web professionals thoughts about content strategy and their attitudes towards web applications. It's also helpful to find out more about the users existing behaviour, in this case the current processes surrounding the creation of a content audit <span class="cite" src="information architecture"></span>.</p>

			<p>Identifying these needs early on in the project is especially helpful in deciding which features are essential to the application ans which are simple nice to have.</p>

		<div class="section" id="conclusions">
			<h2>2.5 Conclusions</h2>
			<p>The main audience for the application would be web design agencies like Ten4 Design who need a solution for completing content audits more quickly, and hence cheaply, than they can using multiple tools and manual techniques.</p>
			<p>The agency would purchase the system and set up user accounts and projects so that team members can run inventories and put together content reports for clients.</p>
			<p>In general the level of technical competency amongst professionals in the content, web and UX/UI strategy fields is high. However, this makes it even more crucial that the application is fast, easy to use and robust enough to stand up to technical scrutiny.</p>
			<p>To meet these requirements I will use Ruby-on-Rails because of its web application background</p>
