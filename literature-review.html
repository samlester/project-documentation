			<p>In this section I will research various areas related to my project including industry practices, content strategy processes, prototyping, web application technologies and competing product. I will also carry out an initial focus group to gain further knowledge of the current industry methodologies, processes and problems surrounding content strategy.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="section" id="content-strategy">
			<h2>2.1 Content strategy</h2>
			<p>Content powers the whole dynamic of the web. Now, with many traditional businesses almost entirely powered by the web it's more important than ever for marketing and sales personnel to stay on top of the content provide by their sites.</p>
			<p>Content strategy is a relatively new field in the web industry which aims to solve these new problems. Closely linked to User Experience Design, it's a broad term which covers the processes used to examine the systems and processes that create and distribute and analyse content.</p>

			<h3>The importance of content for clients</h3>
			<p>While the purposes of different websites vary massively the majority of commercial properties have a few business goals in common. They either aim to persuade you to carry out an action (e.g. buying a book on Amazon, sharing a cat video on YouTube) or provide you with information about a product, topic, service.</p>
			<p>The content provided by a website is the vehicle that links these business goals with the user and clients are now beginning to consider the quality, organisation and relevance of their content over the design and visual style of the site.</p>
			<p>The simple fact is that websites with great content attract more visitors and whether that results in more sales, happier customers or a video going viral it's generally a good thing. The flip side is that bad content drives people away. Halvorson and Rach (2012, p. 15) note that "when content sucks &mdash; when it's overwritten, redundant, hard-to-find, irrelevant &mdash; people come, look, and leave. And sometimes they never come back."</p>
			
			<h3>Content auditing</h3>
			<p>The majority of projects now being approached by web agencies are re-designs of existing sites rather than entirely new ventures, the sub-field of content auditing aims to analyse the content on the old site for the purposes of either informing the design and development of a new site or the updating of content on the existing one.</p>
			<p>Kissane (2011 p. 52) notes that we need to need to discover and assess what content already exists before even thinking about how to structure or design a replacement site. On smaller sites this is relatively easy to do, it's a process of simply clicking through the navigation and looking at the structure of the content. On larger sites with hundreds of pages this is a much more difficult objective. Older sites have often grown far beyond their original designers and developers intended and there are lots of pages buried deep within different sub-sections.</p>
			<p>The process of collecting standard information (e.g. title, URL, metadata, H1) about all the existing pages on a website is often called a quantitative audit or content inventory. Carrying out a quantitative audit is important because it allows an agency to assess the content and structure of a current site so they can see the areas which most need improvement and attention during the design of the new site. It's also one of the quickest and easiest ways to find out about the site content as it can be automated (Halvorson, K. and Rach M., 2012, p. 15).</p>
			<p>Many content strategists use a qualitative approach to assess websites, providing a deeper look at the quality and usefulness of the content to particular user groups. This approach is much more informal and often aims to make a judgement on whether larger areas and of the site are performing as required rather than analysing specific pages.</p>
			<p>Halvorson and Rach (2012, p. 53) note that quantitative audits are helpful but only up to a certain point. The main problem is that the process only gives you the most basic information about the pages rather than more in-depth opinion and assessment of content quality, relevance and usefulness. While this makes the process somewhat less useful than a qualitative audit it also makes it a lot easier to do automatically using the same technologies that search engines use to 'spider' web pages.</p>
			<p>The ideal solution would be to combine elements of both the qualitative and quantitative approaches to allow web agencies to audit websites quickly while still adding and reviewing content quality and relevance.</p>

			<h3>Assessing content quality, relevance and usefulness</h3>
			<p>When assessing the quality of content many content strategists simply write notes about the site rather than putting their thoughts in any kind of order. This means that the information contained in a qualitative audit can be difficult to understand and digest particularly if handed directly to clients.</p>
			<p>Kadec (2013, p. 142) suggests three broad categories into which all 'bad content' can be categorised:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Redundant: Page that is no longer necessary or is duplicated elsewhere</li>
				<li>Out-of-date: Pages that should be on the site but need updating to continue being relevant</li>
				<li>Trivial: Pages that don't contain any useful or relevant information</li>
			</ul>
			<p>An approach which uses an automated method to retrieve information about the pages on a website and a framework for qualitative information like the one above would provide the perfect balance between the two approaches to auditing.</p>

		<div class="section" id="user-interface-design">
			<h2>2.2 User interface design</h2>
			<p>The visualisation and design of complex user interface design has become a large field in recent years and now contains a variety of techniques and disciplines.</p>

			<h3>Wireframing</h3>
			<p>Wireframing is a key stage to developing web applications which involved taking ideas and thoughts from earlier planning stages and expressing them on paper for the first time.</p>
			<p>Effective wireframes show the structure and layout of the page without adding superfluous details like colour or design style. This method of showing only the basics of each page makes them ideal for exploring and iterating different user flows, layouts and ideas.</p>

			<h3>Iterative design</h3>
			<p>Iterative design is a design methodology that focuses on a core cycle of design, testing and analysis, its focus being on creating better user interfaces though early interaction with the target users.</p>

			<!--<h3>User flow diagrams</h3>-->

			<h3>Visual design</h3>
			<p>A crucial aspect of any web application is it's look and feel. This visual side changes the feel of the product to make it fit in more closely with the target market.</p>

			<h4>Design trends</h4>
			<p>A recent trend in the visual design of web applications is 'flat design', a clear reaction to the overly skeuomorphic designs that have previously dominated the market.</p>

			<!--<p><strong>IMAGE: WINDOWS PHONE VS IOS</strong></p>-->
			
			<h3>Websites vs. web applications</h3>
			<p>Although web applications are built using many of the same technologies as websites they are fundamentally different.</p>
			<p>For this reason common information architecture tools like site maps, card sorting and . are unnecessary as they are concerned with organising information rather than leading the user through a process.</p>
			<p>Zamboni (2012, p. 123) shows the differences very succinctly by directly comparing the users goals and concerns when they are using a website as opposed to a web app:</p>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr>
						<th></th>
						<th>Website</th>
						<th>Web app</th>
					</tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<th>User goal</th>
						<td>Find information</td>
						<td>Complete a task</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>User journey</th>
						<td>Haphazard</td>
						<td>Linear</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>User interface</th>
						<td>Content and menus</td>
						<td>Forms</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>Primary concern</th>
						<td>Information space</td>
						<td>Application flows</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>Digital technique</th>
						<td>Information architecture</td>
						<td>Interaction design</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>

		<div class="section" id="prototyping">
			<h2>2.3 Prototyping</h2>
			<p>When developing a web application the user is always at the centre of thinking. Rapid prototypes are a great way of integrating the user's opinion in the design and development cycle.</p>
			<p>There are lots of ways of prototyping, each suited to a particular use case or stage of development.</p>

			<h3>Paper prototyping</h3>
			<p>The quickest, cheapest way to create a prototype is using paper. While basic, this low-tech approach can be particularly effective in the early stages of a project when combined with wireframing. Clicks can be simulated by switching between pages which means that some basic user testing is still possible.</p>

			<h3>Web prototyping</h3>
			<p>One practical method of helping iterative design to work in an increasingly technical context is to build quick, dirty prototypes designed to represent the interface in it's most basic form and allow user testing to take place long before the product is at the stage when it could be released into the marketplace.</p>
			<p>Warfel (2009, p. 4) notes that the key thing about prototypes is that they go a lot further that requirements documents by letting potential users experience and design and provide real-time feedback to a developer. Web-based prototypes excel at this by placing the application design within it's real environment. If created especially carefully web prototypes can also be used as a basis for production code.</p>
			
			<h3>Interactive prototyping</h3>
			<p>One of the best ways to prototype web applications is to create a clickable representation of the finished products. There are lots of different tools that can be used to creating them including Powerpoint and Keynote thanks to their link features.</p>
			<p>Alternatively a semi-interactive prototype can be produced using clickthrough images. Although this loses some of the user testing applications that the web-based prototype provides it's much quicker to produce and iterate.</p>

			<h2>2.5 Conclusions</h2>
			<p>The main audience for the application would be web design agencies like Ten4 Design who need a solution for completing content audits more quickly, and hence cheaply, than they can using multiple tools and manual techniques.</p>
			<p>The agency would purchase the system and set up user accounts and projects so that team members can run inventories and put together content reports for clients.</p>
			<p>In general the level of technical competency amongst professionals in the content, web and UX/UI strategy fields is high. However, this makes it even more crucial that the application is fast, easy to use and robust enough to stand up to technical scrutiny.</p>
			<p>To meet these requirements I will use Ruby-on-Rails because of its web application background</p>
