			<h2>6.1 Methodology</h2>
			<p>For the testing of the application I decided to use a piece of user testing software called <a href="http://silverbackapp.com/">Silverback</a> which runs in the background and records the test computer's screen as well as input from webcam and microphone.</p>
			<p>A video can then be exported which shows the application and the participant's reactions alongside each other.</p>

			<h2>6.2 Participants and setup</h2>
			<p>I tested Scoop individually with with 6 members of the Ten4 Design team. Each participant was given an example username and password to log in to the system and an example site to crawl (<a href="http://madeinbrunel.com">Made in Brunel</a>). To ensure that analytics data could be retrieved the relevant Google account was logged in prior to the start of the testing.</p>
			<p>Before each test the participant was briefed on the purpose of the system and encouraged to give feedback on the application interface and functionality as they went along. Below I will paraphrase the key points that arose from the testing for each participant.</p>

			<h3>Participant 1: John Stewart</h3>

			<p>John Stewart is a UI Developer and Project Manager at Ten4 Design. His work is split between project management and developing various sites using Content Management Systems like ExpressionEngine. He also has experience with SaaS (Software as a Service) products having developed one as Product Manager at another company, Quarter. He raised the following key points:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>There's not enough feedback when waiting for the crawl to complete. The application should inform the user of the number of pages crawled if the waiting time goes over a certain time.</li>
				<li>There's no timescale above the statistics on the page categorisation screen.</li>
				<li>More statistics could be included.</li>
				<li>When authorising Google Analytics it's a bit strange that the process takes you away from the application. A popup window would be better.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Participant 2: Liz Walker</h3>

			<p>Liz Walker is a Director and Project Manager at Ten4 Design. Her work varies from day to day but consists mainly of communicating effectively with clients, delegating tasks to members of the team and helping to plan websites using industry standard methods like wireframes and site maps. She raised the following key points:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The application provided a clear way to make comparisons between pages.</li>
				<li>The system could be used at a very early stage in a project, even to make quotes.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Participant 3: Owen Matthews</h3>

			<p>Owen Matthews is a Director and Designer at Ten4 design. His work mainly consists of working closely with the strategy team to create designs from page wireframes but he's also often involved in writing proposals for clients and analysing sites using Google Analytics. He raised the following key points:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The process taken through the application might be unclear for first time users. Descriptions of the process and a more directed user flow would be better.</li>
				<li>There's not enough feedback when waiting for the crawl to complete. The application could display a message which explains what's happening behind the scenes during the crawl.</li>
				<li>The link to analyse pages isn't clear enough, it should be a bigger action button to draw the user towards starting the process.</li>
				<li>Information about the total number of pages or the amount of pages left to analyse should be available on the edit page screen.</li>
				<li>The content status drop-down should be set to a default (good) to make the process less repetitive. Pages are more likely to be highlighted as particularly bad rather than particularly good.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Participant 4: Dave Adcock</h3>

			<p>Dave Adcock is a Director and Project Manager at Ten4 Design. His work mainly consists of client management including attending meetings and liaising with clients over email and phone. He also creates and updates wireframes, sitemaps and proposals and delegates deisgn and development tasks to other team members. He raised the following key points:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The application was very easy to use.</li>
				<li>It would be very useful on large sites.</li>
				<li>Asked about whether the quality of the audited site affects the quality of the results as often sites which are to be redesigned aren't of a high quality.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Participant 5: Andy Green</h3>

			<p>Andy Green is a Front-end Developer at Ten4 Design. His work mainly consists of creating websites from mockups and integrating them with various Content Management Systems. He also advises designers on technical limitations during the planning and design phase to ensure development goes as smoothly as possible. He raised the following key points:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The grey buttons look disabled.</li>
				<li>Some pages might have good and bad content. It'd be good to be able to mark specific content on the page as a status.</li>
				<li>The contact information box is too vague, perhaps separate fields would be better.</li>
				<li>More statistics could be included. Device statistics would be particularly interesting.</li>
				<li>The content status drop-down should be set to a default (good) to make the process less repetitive.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Charlotte Jackson is a Front-end Developer and Strategist at Ten4 Design. Her work is a mixture of HTML/CSS development, CMS integration and UX design tasks like creating wireframes, sitemaps and content matrices</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Would be good to be able to reorder pages on the table views, particularly when creating reports.</li>
				<li>The application was very easy to use</li>
				<li>The table columns could be sortable.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>6.3 Findings</h2>
			<p>Overall the results of the testing have been extremely positive. To conclude the project I will review the objectives that I set at the start of the project and check that I met them fully.</p>
			
			<h3>Design a user interface that makes it simple to gather data about a website</h3>
			<p>The user interface is clean, easy to use and embraces the flat design style. Overall feedback during the testing was positive with only a few small interface tweaks suggested by the participants.mWhen presented with tasks to complete using the system the participants were not hesitant in following the user flow though and could find parts of the system with ease.</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Great design, simple layout and easy to use.</p>
				<cite>Andy Green, Developer, Ten4 Design</cite>
			</blockquote>

			<h3>Create a web app which allows users to carry out content audits quickly</h3>
			<p>One of the things that was most clear from the testing was that the participants were pleased with the time saving of the system vs. the traditional method of creating audits using spreadsheets. Speed is a clear reason for the system to be used instead of traditional methods.</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Clearly has a practical application in the industry. I would have used it myself on a recent project, if it was available.</p>
				<cite>Owen Matthews, Director/Designer, Ten4 Design</cite>
			</blockquote>
			
			<h3>Allow the user to export useful information and statistics from the app</h3>
			<p>The fixed format reports allow the user to export reports from the application which are not too detailed nor too sparse. I believe Scoop hits the sweet spot between too much and too little, enabling the generated report to be used on its own or in addition to a formal proposal document.</p>
