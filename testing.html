			<h2>6.1 Methodology</h2>
			<p>For the testing of the application I decided to use a piece of user testing software called <a href="http://silverbackapp.com/">Silverback</a> which runs in the background and records the test computer's screen as well as input from webcam and microphone.</p>
			<p>A video can then be exported which shows the application and the participant's reactions alongside each other.</p>

			<h2>6.2 Participants and setup</h2>
			<p>I tested Scoop individually with with 6 members of the Ten4 Design team. Each participant was given an example username and password to log in to the system and an example site to crawl (<a href="http://madeinbrunel.com">Made in Brunel</a>). To ensure that analytics data could be retrieved the relevant Google account was logged in prior to the start of the testing.</p>
			<p>Before each test the participant was briefed on the purpose of the system and encouraged to give feedback on the application interface and functionality as they went along. Below I will outline the key points that arose from the testing for each participant.</p>
