			<h2>What's your current process for planning a website?</h2>

			<p>JS: Usually start off with a meeting with the client to understand the brief that they sent through in a little bit more detail, which will often include a precursory look at the current site if there is one just to try and understand what they're getting up to and what the current structure and what current content they've got and all that kind of stuff.
			</p>
			<p>And then from the meeting we'll kind of tease out exactly what the requirements are of the new site. And then we'll then respond with a proposal based on their brief which will outline our approach to the the project which would include things like any specific detail in terms of content management or technology or specific requirements for a section or anything like that. Also, timings and costs and everything. Anything else
			</p>
			<p>LW: I don't think so. I suppose that initial meeting as well is about setting targets and stuff so you then have the measure of how successful a project's been at the end.
			</p>
			<h2>Would you say that that process of planning a website has changed because of the shift towards mobile recently?</h2>

			<p>JS: Yes. Not as much as it probably should do. I think it's going to continue to change. I think it would be interesting to do a sort of mobile first approach to a site because that will really affect the strategy in terms of content because digesting content is very different to digesting content through desktop - you need to be a lot more concise, easy to navigate through, all that kind of stuff. And in terms of actually being able to access content on mobile we're obviously getting a lot more requests that it's got to work on iPads and iPhones. We're looking at techniques to make it work across all those platforms – responsive web design that will work on a desktop, tablet and mobile. Making sure video works correctly and plugging in certain content mainly with external providers like Vimeo and YouTube who provide player that are suitable for mobile consumption. Also in some situations using other players that are a bit more customisable - like on the Passion website where we had to get everything encoded correctly so it would play through on the site.
			</p>
			<p>LW: I think it's quite interesting – I think things have changed  a lot but I think still at the kind of content strategy level things haven't really changed so the way we're kind of approaching mobile is to kind of design a website and then kind of make sure that the design works and the function works but in terms of the content we're not really stripping out very much, i think we've stripped out some bits on Derwent, maybe a bit on Buro4 in terms of making sure thinks play but it's not about the actual content whereas we're putting in proposals at the moment for a financial company and one of their kind of requirement is that the mobile version is simplified in terms of the amount of content that people can actually access and need because the chances are they're just not going to spend the time that they would browsing on a desktop that they would on a mobile. So I think that at the strategy level we probably need to - I think it will become more and more important. At the moment it's just the whole lot goes on  but I think that needs to be sharpened up.
			</p>
			<p>JS: I think that that risks - is that we'll probably approach it in the fashion that all the content will be there but we'll try and - the user journey will be that they can experience it in smaller chunks. So that they can look at a services section, they can get a broader overview of all the services and they can drill down for the detail. I  wouldn't like to eliminate content completely because it's not really a great user experience.
			</p>
			<p>LW: one of the things they discussed in the meeting was actually trying to strip back some of the heavy copy that's just - they want to have on the website but they just don't want it, they just don't think it's, they don't think people are going to read it but I guess there's maybe an argument-
			</p>
			<p>JS: There needs to be a balance between the two. It can be incredibly annoying if you'd visited the site and you went to show somebody on your mobile and you weren't able to get to the content you'd seen on the desktop on the mobile.
			</p>
			<p>LW: That's true.
			</p>
			<p>JS: SO there'd have to be - I think maybe that's what they want and in their heads basically what they're truing to do is simplify the user experience. I think we can maybe do that in another way.
			</p>
			<p>LW: So it's more about simplifying the journey.
			</p>
			<p>JS: I think so though I haven't really looked at it in much detail.
			</p>
			<p>AG; It's more about hiding stuff away. It's still there, it's just not, it doesn't start there - you have to get through and access it.
			</p>
			<p>JS: Yeah, lil having little read more links that extend the content out so that you have the content. The content should be structured so that the top should be a summary anyway, the top paragraph. And then if you want to read more there's a little button or something that reveals the rest - so you can get the information on mobile maybe. But it's quite a new are for us really. It;s something that we need to explore.
			</p>
			<p>LW: But it's more about kind of expanding and being able to see more if you choose.
			</p>
			<p>JS: It's about chunking it all up so that its, so that its more sort of skim through it. That's what I think anyway.
			</p>
			<p>AG: I think it's important that our mobile sites aren't worse version of our main sites. They should have everything on them that the main site does just not necessarily all in one place.
			</p>
			<p>LW: Yeah because I know one thing we were talking about the other day was images because Buro4's site is so  heavy on images we were you know, wanting it to to kind of function and work as well on mobile as it does on the desktop and trying to get that balance again of making sure we do it.
			</p>
			<p>AG: I think the design is kind of…
			</p>
			<p>LW: Yeah, if we'd have been in charge of that.
			</p>
			<p>JS: I think in terms of the way that we approach a project in terms of design and thinking about images it should be in the back of our minds that this is gonna be potentially downloaded on a low bandwidth device - it's not going to have a big screen and  we should think about how best we could serve those images.
			</p>
			<p>I think Buro is a pretty bad example because the images are kind   of the design aren't they - they make the design
			</p>
			<p>PArts of Derwent are probably a bit better but there are parts of Derwent that are incredibly slow. Things like the properties page has maybe a hundred properties on it so we could maybe look at lazy-loading images and things like that on mobile.
			</p>
			<p>LW: In terms of the Farm, did you think that that. Does the Farm, do you think the Farm translates quite well but it's still quite image heavy isn't it, we've got big background images.
			</p>
			<p>SL: Yea, I mean you can have lots of imagery but it's just making sure that it works on mobile as well. That would be my opinion.
			</p>
			<p>JS: And that it's optimised so that if there is a lot of images you're making it the best experience possible on mobile because I think it's always going to be a balancing act between the two. If you're creating an experience that runs across different platforms never one is going to be perfect because if we did it purely mobile the experience on the desktop would be quite, you know, could be quite limited - it terms of images. So we have to look at the ways to make it balance.
			</p>
			<h2>Well, from that it sounds like there's more content strategy work to be done when you have to chunk content up and simplify it and there's work there. Do you find it difficult to sell that to clients? The extra work that you have to put in on content and UX.</h2>

			<p>LW: Absolutely.
			</p>
			<p>JS: Clients don't understand it at all. Until they actually get to the point where they have to do it themselves. You know, we'll put time in for content population or costs. Give them all the resources they need to provide us with the content as early as possible in the most structured way but they never really seem to respond that well.
			</p>
			<p>LW: I think until you actually do it you never realise what's involved, and maybe that's partly on our side - that we need to be more, you know, give them more of an idea of the actual process, the step-by-step process because it does get to, it's a race towards the end. I think actually the Buro project they've done quite a good job of populating. We put in place for them a copy deck which was shared on Google Docs and they were very good at populating that - they didn't touch it after we sort of said we're using this now and we had very clear guidelines that they actually did everything we asked and put all their pictures in one place and labeled them correctly. So that makes a huge difference but I think there could be more. Again that process could definitely be sharpened up.
			</p>
			<p>JS: It's a good sign when you meet a client that up front asks for a copywriter because immediately it shows you that they see the value in their content and so when it happens on occasion it's usually on a project which has a bigger budget. Usually comes down to budget this kind of thing. Content is normally seen as something that somebody within the company as part of their normal day job can do when really it's a lot bigger job than that, isn't it. And the actually collating it, let alone making it succinct enough for mobile and desktop and in-between.
			</p>
			<p>LW: And I think the nature of the kind of digital medium really means that people thing "Oh, I can just change it later" and rather than if you're sending copy to print you know, you're putting together a brochure, a printed brochure, you have to make sure that copy is perfect whereas I think people think the whole transitional nature of it is "We'll put it up there and see how it reads" which is kind of a back to front way of doing it. Really all this stuff should be done up front, that should be one of the first things that people do and to be honest the majority do not do that - they leave it to the last minute, it's the last thing they do whereas in my opinion I think the content should be one of the first things that's kind of nailed down. Just because it would be better in terms of design, it would be better in terms of planning functionality if we knew what we had up front.
			</p>
			<p>JS: Yeah, I mean ideally content would come pre-wireframing. We'd want wire framing with real content, we'd structure the site with real content. A lot of the stumbling block we come across in the, probably in both phases - design and build - would be that when they get the design they say "Well we want o be able to do this and add this" and then you're like well that's going need a redesign. And you come to the build and it's the second phase of them going "Actually we want to be able to do this and this and this". Whereas if that was all done up front that would all be a lot easier.
			</p>
			<p>LW: The trouble is that when the project's on a very tight timeframe we kind of get to the stage where people just say "Ok, I've got 8 weeks, we need to build a website, we don't really know what's going to go in it can you just make it look nice". So we actually start with very little and it's almost up to use to pre-guess, to pre-determine what that content's going to be and then they fit around it which is kind of completely the wrong way of doing it. I think it really needs to be, it's interesting just talking about it, it makes me think yeah we should really be getting a better idea - at least a shape of the content - up front.
			</p>
			<p>JS: We do do that a little bit in terms of our proposals have an outline in the proposal - the structure but it does need to go a bit further does't it?
			</p>
			<p>LW: Well, I think quite often we use as a reference - because tis the only reference we have - the existing sites. It doesn't mean it's necessarily the right thing to do. What Owen's doing now with the Anabel Karmel project is that he's doing a <em>website audit</em> so that we have a much better and clearer idea of what's there but that in itself is kind of a huge task.
			</p>
			<p>JS: And usually the budgets don't allow - budgets and timing don't allow for that kind of… If we said to a client that we are going to spend I don't know 10, 20 % of their budget on just looking at their old site they're just going to be like "no, why are you doing that" but I mean if the budget is big and the site is massive it then seems like a really great idea.
			</p>
			<p>LW: Well you can learn a lot of lessons about what they've done before, what they've done wrong. I think it's, you know, valuable. They'll know the website isn't work because it doesn't  work on mobile phones or whatever but there's a lot more to it than that.
			</p>
			<p>AG: I think a lot of clients don't even really know what they want to say. We should help them figure it out. Why do they need a website?
			</p>
			<p>LW: They know they need a web presence but that's about it.
			</p>
			<p>AG: "Because it looks nice!"
			</p>
			<p>JS: I think also, when they've actually come to the point where they've got everything in place. You know, they've got their content and everything like that there hold be a process of actually refining that. Like is this exactly right and how can we test that. That is something very interesting - keeping a site alive. I think people like John Jones are doing that quite well, they're constantly revisiting the site and looking at how things are performing. They work with and SEO expert on the SEO side of things but it is interesting. I think the more crucial the website is to the business the more they're focused on it content wise. So if like John Jones have started to run a shop through their website and it's suddenly become and e-commerce portal so they're really heavily invested in making it perfect. Same with Anabel Karmel, that is kind of a huge revenue generator but if you've got a company that their revenue streams are elsewhere then they're less focused on their actual website.
			</p>
			<h2>So on that note you said about refining content - what is the best way, and what processes and tools do you use to measure the effectiveness of content on a website?</h2>

			<p>JS: At the moment we're pretty rubbish at that! Well we use Google Analytics obviously to track how people are using the site, that'll give us an indication of what's popular, what's not popular - that kind of thing. In terms of John Jones what they do is they look at what isn't performing and they look at tweaking it and then monitoring how that tweak improves things. A recent proposal we're working on they're quite keen to do some split A/B testing so they're actually going to come up with a couple of messages in terms of the homepage for example and both messages would be served up to different people and they will then monitor analytics of how those people then went on to perhaps phone them up or contact them via email, who went through into the services section etc, etc. Then we make a decision on which is the best one to go with and then maybe refine that one  a little bit further, do another split test and  see how it performs. They're looking at doing this on a monthly basis, trying new messages each month and seeing how they perform and then continually refining the content based on how people interact with them. Kind of using it as a sales tool.
			</p>
			<p>LW: I think it's a tool that companies haven't really - well not in our experience - explored that much. You've got a perfect focus group, we're all online users and yet we're not using a website to test brand messages - it could be used a lot more effectively if strategies were put in place early on. Let's see, let's test it, let's explore. I think there's huge potential that's just not being…
			</p>
			<p>JS: And again it does kind of come down to clients not understanding the value of it and also budgets. You know we'd love to be able to offer all these services to people but we kin dog have to prioritise what we can offer based on the budget that they provide us with. I think that the ongoing thing is the really interesting thing because that's where you can get a lot of the content refinement from, is looking at how things are going . And I think probably, from a clients point of view when they're collating the content they probably look at the current site and look at the content that's there and try and refine that a little bit as well. See what works well and what doesn't work well. So there is a bit of a process between the old site and the new site.
			</p>
			<p>LW: But it is quite basic at the moment.
			</p>
			<p>JS: Oh, very much so. I mean somebody who does have any… that hasn't looked at the analytics for example, they're just doing it off the top of their heads…
			</p>
			<p>LW: It's just kind of instinct - whatever they think which isn't very scientific.
			</p>
			<p>JS: And then there's no way of measuring whether it's performing  better or not.
			</p>
			<p>LW: But I think things have changes so much. I mean 5, 10 years ago people would make a website and that would be it, you know, you'd just kind of leave it out to pasture and that's it. Whereas now I think people are sort of realising that if they do that - if they just put their website up and leave it for 2-5 years or whatever - then it's going to go redundant and they're going to have to shell out again and revisit it. Whereas the site is a kind of living thing that needs to be constantly monitored, things need to be worked on all the time. Technology's changing, they should all  be running in parallel really and I think the value of that is something that as a company we should - we already are - start to look at how we can kind of offer a more of a digital partnership with our clients sot that they know that this is a very useful tool and that they need to nurture it to get the most out of it otherwise it will just kind of fall by the wayside and they start again. So it's a bit kind of educating people I think, just because it's all so new and people aren't up to speed.
			</p>
			<h2>So continuing on from that point do you have any processes in place to assess websites that you've built as time goes on?</h2>

			<p>JS: Not unless we're getting paid for it.
			</p>
			<p>LW: Yeah.
			</p>
			<p>JS: This is the catch-22 because we can't spend time monitoring other people's sites if they're not willing to 1, action  our points - we could come up with loads of great ideas for them but they're probably not willing to spend the money. But sites that we do manage, like John Jones, we're kind of looking at how new offerings that they have - such as this online store - can be better integrated into the site and through that then how that turns into bigger conversions on the store, that kind of thing.
			</p>
			<p>AG: We do have project debriefs, occasionally. I don't know how common they are.
			</p>
			<p>LW: They should be at the end of every project.
			</p>
			<p>AG: We say what we promised we'd do, what we did, did we meet our targets, that kind of thing.
			</p>
			<p>LW: It's at quite a basic level.
			</p>
			<p>AG: And quite soon after it's done.
			</p>
			<p>LW: Yea, and I think the other thing is, although we haven't done many of these, is the site health check which John kind of put together a template for actually looking at where a webiste is and it's actually how we've got the ongoing work with John Jones isn't it. On the back of that.
			</p>
			<p>JS: It gives the client a snapshot of how things are and allows us to provide them with a list of recommendations and say you know, you should look at doing this, this and this. And then they can choose to spread that out over whatever time period they want and prioritise them depending on what their commercial  activities are and all that kind of stuff. It is something I'd like to do more of. I think it'd be very interesting to set targets at the beginning of the project. So, what do you want to get out of this? Are we wanting to increase traffic by this much? And then obviously say after so many months we're going to come back to you and show you whether that's happened or not - and if if it hasn't come back to you with a load of ideas of how to make it happen.
			</p>
			<p>LW: Yeah, I think you're right, going back to your earlier point about actually if a site is being used to generate revenue, you know those kind of things, it becomes far more crucial to people. I mean, for us actually targeting the sort of people who might be interested in this kind of service, I think it'd be people who actually need to, although it could - it should - be across the board but primarily…
			</p>
			<p>JS: I think the focus is a lot clearer if you're making money out of your website. Whereas if it's a company that promoting themselves through their website the website isn't directly generating revenue, as such. It probably is, people are looking at it and calling them up but there's no link between the two. I think once that link is tangible and you can kind of say "oh actually…"
			</p>
			<p>AG: You can't really tell if a visitor to say, Buro4 is part of the industry and cares about it. There's no end point of success like in a shop. Sheer traffic isn't what they'd be looking for, they'd be looking for the right traffic but that's difficult to judge. We have referrals from somewhere… 
			</p>
			<p>LW: Or whether they're contacting relevant locations and people from the website - that might be an interesting way of measuring…
			</p>
			<p>JS: A client recently, they've actually got a contact relationship manager, they've actually got lists of IPs and which clients they match to so that when the client visits the site from a certain company they know that they've been working with or have worked with they can offer them up the correct account manager to contact or the right sales information just so that they're kind of tailoring the experience for that client. That's quite interesting.
			</p>
			<p>LW: It becomes much more sort of personal experience as opposed to a generic one.
			</p>
			<p>JS: But that's a very kind of specialised industry and they've obviously worked for a long time to get that data. That's kind of their specialism as well.
			</p>
			<p>LW: Yeah, that's true.
			</p>
			<h2>So when you're carrying out these planning processes - content strategy, UX design, things like that - it it generally done by the project manager or another person? And does that person generally carry it through to built constantly thinking about content or does it kind of drop off?</h2>

			<p>JS: I think being a small company it's sort of a mixture of all of those things. Oftwen a project will run with the same person from beginning to end in terms of project management but sometimes that changes just because other things crop up and people have their own specialisms. In terms of a project manager looking at content I think initially the project manger would, they're the one that comes up with the proposal, they're the one who evaluates the current site, they're the one who meets with the client and forms the initial strategy. I then guess often content is perhaps ignored in the design process, just because we haven't got it at that point so it kind of goes by the wayside and then come build it might become part of the role of the web developer to take on what is and isn't there, what needs to be there, what needs to be better and making sure the content's performing correctly, in the right place and stuff. It's kind of a mixture, isn't it?
			</p>
			<p>LW: It is.
			</p>
			<p>JS: And I think duringg the build part it's the project managers role because they;re constantly liaising with the client and getting that content back and refining it and all that kind of stuff. It's kind of a team thing.
			</p>
			<p>LW: I think in bigger companies there'd be maybe a content strategist who, that'd be their job, just making sure all the content is in place but obviously on a smaller scale its kind of  goes through the journey of the project with the person who's working on it at that time and then the idea is that there would be somebody who's kind of overseeing the whole lot - in an ideal world. It's a challenge.
			</p>
			<p>JS: You can kind of see on the Anabel Karmel site which is a really richly populated site, lots of content, that we're currently auditing for the client the person who's done all of it, which is Owen is probably going to have the best over-arching view of content on that site and it's probably going to have to remain for the rest of the project because he'll know exactly what's going on, what's going where, what needs to be done, that kind of thing. So, in terms of the bigger project I think there will be a more specialised role. Owen might ton necessarily be the project manager but he'll have that kind of focus of content and then he'll be able to liase with developers and the designers of what needs to go where and all that kind of stuff.
			</p>
			<p>LW: Yeah, just because you have that kind of knowledge.
			</p>
			<h2>So, you were talking about a website or content audit. In what situations would you do one of those? With or without budget or why you do it? What would be your motivation?</h2>

			<p>JS: If budget wasn't an issue?
			</p>
			<p>SL: Well, either way. Do you do it on high budget projects or low budget projects or both or is it something you'd have to charge for?
			</p>
			<p>JS: Sometimes it's built into the project itself. If the project brief is vague and we want to get a bit more information from the client we try and do the audit up front and get paid part of the project budget up front so a content audit can take place and we can really nail down the brief because more often than not the client doesn't really understand the site either. So ti's a bit of a working out the what's and why's of a site and users and all that kind of stuff. Budget does play a huge roile in whether we can offer it or not. And also the client's understanding and willing ness to actually, you know, pay for it because if they don't see the value it in and they think they can do it all themselves then its very difficult to sell it o them.
			</p>
			<h2>So if it was quicker and easier to carry out that process you'd be able to offer it on a wider range of projects?</h2>

			<p>JS: Absolutely, if there's any way we could streamline the process that Owen has gone through - looking at analytics, trying to work out what content is popular, what isn't popular, what isn't being used, demographics like what countries people come from especially if they're focusing on other markets - if that whole process could be streamlined it's be very helpful.
			</p>
			<p>LW: Yeah and I think as a way of then being able to produce something to show the client based on all that research, to kind of streamline that process of creating something that is kind of digestible.
