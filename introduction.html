			<p>The original ideas for this project came from my time working at <a href="http://ten4design.co.uk">Ten4 Design</a>.</p>
			<p>Ten4 Design (or Ten4 for short) is a small digital design and development agency based in Shoreditch, London. The specialise in helping their client to create effective websites and campaigns from initial idea to strategy, design and development and eventually launch. They also offer a variety of post-sales services including the 'site health check' â€“ a report on an existing site which brings together analytics and expert advice to suggest potential improvements to content, structure and design.</p>
			<p>For Ten4 a big part of creating an effective and engaging website is the very first stage of the process, strategy. This is where the focus is squarely on looking objectively at the content available to users and how that should be updated to be more useful to the website visitors. It's also an area where there are a lot of manual data-driven processes compared to other areas of the workflow which are much more streamlined. Tasks such as putting data into reports, compiling statistics and analysing webpages are all done in a laborious, drawn-out way.</p>

			<h2><span>1.2</span> Initial ideas</h2>
			<p>The project began with a few simple ideas focused around the idea of simplifying web strategy processes and streamlining the workflow gaps identified above. For each of the ideas below preliminary research was carried out to assess their feasibility and relevance to industry.</p>

			<h3>Content gathering software</h3>

				<h2>Project plan</h2>
				<p>Both the original executive summary and the revised one (which was presented at the interim presentation) are available in the appendix.</p>
				<a href="#">Hello</a>
			</aside>
			<p>The first idea was a web application to help digital agencies collect and organise new content from their clients in a simpler way. Currently, web design companies like Ten4 struggle to get meaningful and appropriate web content from clients in a timely manner and end up chasing down content through emails and then using crude spreadsheets to try and sort text, images, links and video sent by the client.</p>
			<p>From the start the idea seemed quite vague and while the concept of automating the organisation of client content got good feedback from UX designers at Ten4 Design it was difficult to pin down a structure and shape of an application that could work out-of-the-box with so many different sources and types of content. While researching potential competing products I found a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) product called <a href="http://www.gathercontent.com/">GatherContent</a> which aims to tackle the same problem.</p>
			<p>Despite not moving ahead with the idea the preliminary research carried out led to a closer examination of the emerging field of content strategy and deeper thoughts about the sort of tools would actually help content creators, user experience designers and developers to make their web content more effective and ultimately, more profitable.</p>

			<h3>Content auditing tool</h3>
			<p>The next significant idea was a tool that would allow web design agencies to more efficiently carry out the first part of the content strategy process; analysing existing content structure and effectiveness. This process is known as content auditing.</p>
			<p>Currently content auditing is carried out in a very broad way by browsing through the pages, looking up statistical information on Google Analytics and then recording information about the page's content using a crude spreadsheet system. This manual method of carrying out the audit means that it's very time-intensive and as such, is often only performed for larger project where a research budget is available.
			<p>The information obtained from a content audit performed prior to a site redesign is invaluable when making decisions about the new site's UX. It can also be used to back up plans to the client by providing them with qualitative data. If the process could be made quicker and simpler then it could be used on smaller projects to great effect. In addition to the traditional use of a content audit for analysis of sites that are to be redesign the data could also be used to support the improvement of content on existing an client's site by providing them with notes on the quality of each page.</p>
			<p>The proposed application would eliminate much of the manual processing by automatically crawling a site using an automated spidering that works in a similar way to a search engine. Once the pages are retrieved the data could be used in a number of ways including the generation of a report which could be presented to the client. Additional data could be added manually and from analytical data sources like Google Analytics.</p>
			<p>While there are several products on the market which fulfil various parts of the audit process initial research revealed no single product which can pull the process together by using automated crawling, the API's of other statistical information tools and qualitative evaluation of the content.</p>
