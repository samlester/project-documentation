			<p>My original ideas came for this project came from my time working at <a href="http://ten4design.co.uk">Ten4 Design</a>.</p>
			<p>Ten4 Design (or Ten4 for short) is a small digital design and development agency based in Shoreditch, London. The specialise in helping their client to create effective websites and campaigns from initial idea to strategy, design and development and eventually launch.</p>
			<p>A big part of creating an effective website is the first stage of the process, strategy. This is where the focus is squarely on  looking objectively at the content available to users and how that should be updated to be more useful to the website visitors.</p>

			<h2><span>1.2</span> Initial ideas</h2>
			<p>I started off with a few ideas based around the field of content strategy and approaching the workflow gaps from different directions. I did some initial research into each of my ideas to help decide which of them was most appropriate.</p>

			<h3>Content gathering software</h3>
			<p>My first idea was a web application to help agencies collect and organise new and updated content from their clients more easily.</p>
			<p>Currently, web design companies like Ten4 struggle to get meaningful content from clients in a timely manner and have to resort to crude spreadsheets to try and sort text, images, links and video sent by the client.</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Temporibus, delectus, asperiores ipsa illo porro totam necessitatibus debitis ipsum esse quas ea laboriosam doloribus iure dolor optio eveniet eius incidunt illum.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Unfortunately in my initial research into the field I found that there was already a SaaS product available called GatherContent which perfectly fitted the need. Aside from this I talked to several people at Ten4 Design about the nature of the projects that would be used with the system and I decided that an out-of-the-box application would be too unspecific to be helpful.</p>
			<p>This led me to examine the emerging field of content strategy much more closely - what sort of tools will actually help content creators and designers to make their web content more effective and ultimately, more profitable.</p>

			<h3>Content auditing tool</h3>
			<aside class="note pull-right">
				<h2>Hello</h2>
				<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Nihil, nesciunt, necessitatibus, quos facere eligendi voluptas recusandae reprehenderit porro eaque veniam enim earum eos ab debitis facilis. Laborum, aperiam assumenda a.</p>
				<a href="#">Hello</a>
			</aside>
			<p>My second idea was a tool that would allow web design agencies to more efficiently carry out the first part of the strategy process, analysing existing content structure and effectiveness. </p>
			<p>Currently content auditing is carried out in a very broad way using a mixture of manual browsing through the pages and crude spreadsheets to record information about the site.</p>
			<p>While there are several products on the market which fulfil different parts of the audit process there's no single product that can pull the process together by using automated spidering, the API's of other statistical information tools and qualitative evaluation of the content.</p>

			<h2><span>1.3</span> Aim and objectives</h2>

			<h3>Project aim</h3>
			<p>To create a web application that helps web agency staff to audit the content and structure of an existing website and analyse the effectiveness of the content.</p>

			<h3>Product objectives</h3>
			<p>These are my product objectives:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Design a user interface that makes it simple to gather data about a website</li>
				<li>Create a web app which allows users to carry out content audits quickly</li>
				<li>Allow the user to export useful information and statistics from the app</li>
			</ul>
