			<p>The original ideas for this project came from my time working at <a href="http://ten4design.co.uk">Ten4 Design</a>.</p>
			<p>Ten4 Design (or Ten4 for short) is a small digital design and development agency based in Shoreditch, London. The specialise in helping their client to create effective websites and campaigns from initial idea to strategy, design and development and eventually launch. They also offer a variety of post-sales services including the 'site health check' â€“ a report on an existing site which brings together analytics and expert advice to suggest potential improvements to content, structure and design.</p>
			<p>For Ten4 a big part of creating an effective and engaging website is the very first stage of the process, strategy. This is where the focus is squarely on looking objectively at the content available to users and how that should be updated to be more useful to the website visitors. It's also an area where there are a lot of manual data-driven processes compared to other areas of the workflow which are much more streamlined. Tasks such as putting data into reports, compiling statistics and analysing webpages are all done in a laborious, drawn-out way.</p>

			<h2><span>1.2</span> Initial ideas</h2>
			<p>The project began with a few simple ideas focused around the idea of simplifying web strategy processes and streamlining the workflow gaps identified above. For each of the ideas below preliminary research was carried out to assess their feasibility and relevance to industry.</p>

			<h3>Content gathering software</h3>

				<h2>Project plan</h2>
				<p>Both the original executive summary and the revised one (which was presented at the interim presentation) are available in the appendix.</p>
				<a href="#">Hello</a>
			</aside>
			<p>The first idea was a web application to help digital agencies collect and organise new content from their clients in a simpler way. Currently, web design companies like Ten4 struggle to get meaningful and appropriate web content from clients in a timely manner and end up chasing down content through emails and then using crude spreadsheets to try and sort text, images, links and video sent by the client.</p>
			<p>From the start the idea seemed quite vague and while the concept of automating the organisation of client content got good feedback from UX designers at Ten4 Design it was difficult to pin down a structure and shape of an application that could work out-of-the-box with so many different sources and types of content. While researching potential competing products I found a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) product called <a href="http://www.gathercontent.com/">GatherContent</a> which aims to tackle the same problem.</p>
			<p>Despite not moving ahead with the idea the preliminary research carried out led to a closer examination of the emerging field of content strategy and deeper thoughts about the sort of tools would actually help content creators, user experience designers and developers to make their web content more effective and ultimately, more profitable.</p>

			<h3>Content auditing tool</h3>
			<p>The next significant idea was a tool that would allow web design agencies to more efficiently carry out the first part of the content strategy process; analysing existing content structure and effectiveness. </p>
			<p>Currently content auditing is carried out in a very broad way using a mixture of manual browsing through the pages and crude spreadsheets to record information about the site. <span class="more"></span></p>
			<p>While there are several products on the market which fulfil different parts of the audit process there's no single product that can pull the process together by using automated spidering, the API's of other statistical information tools and qualitative evaluation of the content.</p>
			<p>After settling on this idea the aims and objectives could be written.</p>

			<h3>Project aim</h3>
			<p>To create a web application that helps web agency staff to audit the content and structure of an existing website and analyse the effectiveness of the content.</p>

			<h3>Product objectives</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Design a user interface that makes it simple to gather data about a website</li>
				<li>Create a web app which allows users to carry out content audits quickly</li>
				<li>Allow the user to export useful information and statistics from the app</li>
			</ul>
