			<h2>Design</h2>
			<p>In this section I will discuss my planning and design process for the graphical user interface of tha application.</p>

			<h3>Wireframing</h3>
			<p>My first task in beginning to visualise the web application interface was to sketch wireframes of potential interface ideas.</p>

			<h2>Technologies</h2>
			<p>In this section I will explore the different technologies users to build, host and maintain web applications and ultimately make a decision about which technologies should be used in this project.</p>
			
			<h3>Languages</h3>
			<p>There are many different languages I could use to create the application.</p>

			<h4>PHP</h4>
			<p>One of the languages commonly used for dynamic websites and web applications is PHP. It was originally created from by taking bits of syntax from three other languages (C, Java, and Perl) </p>

			<h4>Ruby/Python</h4>
			<p>In recent years new languages have emerged to allow for the quicker and more efficient development of web applications. These languages are built to be extremely fast and lightweight without all of the historical idiosyncrasies that come with older languages. </p>
			<p>Ruby was publicly released in 1995 but gained popularity on the web in 2006. It is designed to be simple in appearance but allow for complex systems to be built.</p>
			<p>Python was created prior to Ruby (in 1989) but follows a very similar syntax.</p>
			
			<h3>Application frameworks</h3>
			<p>An application framework is a set of preset infrastructure which allows for the quicker development of an application. They generally contain all of the basic functions that a web application requires, saving the time of creating them for each new application. They also follow certain conventions so that developers can collaborate easily without having to learn a custom-built structure each time.</p>
			<p>Having decided that Ruby is the best language choice for this project I will now look at the available application frameworks I could use during development.</p>

			<h4>Rails</h4>
			<p><a href="http://rubyonrails.org/" title="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby-on-rails</a> (RoR) was developed in 2003 for use by 37signals in building web applications.</p>
			<p>37signals' current generation of applications (Basecamp, Campfire and Highrise) still run on Rails, allowing the teams that develop and maintain them to have flexibility in the direction of the product while providing stable APIs and data feeds.</p>
			
			<h4>Sinatra</h4>
			<p><a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/" title="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a> is a lightweight, open source Ruby framework developed by Blake Mizerany. It is focused on being easy and quick to use, requiring minimal effort from the developer.</p>

			<h3>Cloud hosting</h3>
			<p>Generally, web applications require more resources to run than website as they are more intensive on the server.</p>
			<p>Services like Heroku, Pagoda Box and App Cloud provide managed servers in the cloud.</p>

			<h3>Versioning and bug tracking</h3>
			<p>In a project as dynamic as this one it's important to keep track of bugs that occur as well as being able to roll back to previous versions of the software. There are a variety of software packages available to facilitate this.</p>
			<p>Git is a versioning and Source Code Management (SCM) package which allows developers of applications to keep several revisions of their code.</p>
			<p>Github is a web application (incidentally built on Ruby) which allows the publishing and sharing of Git repositories.</p>

			<h3>Bootstrap</h3>
			<p>Twitter Bootstrap is an open source front-end development framework that allows for the creation of the basic structure of  websites and web applications to be accomplished extremely quickly. It provides a large library of standard UI paradigms along with basic CSS and JavaScript to support them.</p>
